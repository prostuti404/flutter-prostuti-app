/// and `liveClassesUsed` for the signed-in student, and [AccessControl] uses
/// those directly. This class remains for a backend that predates them (or a
/// config fetched without a token): when a user's clock started, and how much
/// of a capped feature they have spent, are tracked here instead.
///
/// **Every key is scoped to a user id**, so two accounts sharing a phone keep
/// separate counters and logging back in restores your own.
///
/// **These keys deliberately survive logout.** `AuthNotifier.clearTokens()`
/// removes only the four token keys, so signing out no longer resets a trial
/// (it also no longer resets the user's chosen language). They do not survive
/// "Clear data", and on iOS they do not survive reinstall; on Android they may
/// or may not, depending on Google auto-backup. Those are known, accepted holes
/// in a fallback path that the server-side state makes moot.
